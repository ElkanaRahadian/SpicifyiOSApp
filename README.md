## Our Synthesis
Indonesian spices are one of the endemic ingredients that are very close to Indonesian people and also one of the important ingredients in Indonesian dishes because of their benefits, such as health benefits, being a natural preservative, and enhancing the flavor of the dish, as every spice has its own unique taste and aroma.

From research and interviews with beginner home cooks, it's been found that identifying spices can play a big role during ingredient preparation. Once the spices are identified, they can proceed further in the cooking process. One way of identifying spices is by their form and characteristics. According to interviews and research, visual learning is one of the best methods because students can respond to visual information faster than they can to text-only materials.

Accuracy during identification can help them be better at correctly identifying the ingredients, maintaining the quality and freshness of the ingredients, and expediting the preparation of the ingredients. Hence, the quality of their dishes will improve as well.
Therefore, identifying spice difficulty can be resolved using:

1. Visual recognition: by its form and shape
2. Visual information: displaying the spices' characteristics and usage for each dish. This will help young adults efficiently manage and organize their cooking ingredients, which will improve their knowledge about spices and the quality of their dishes.
